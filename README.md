The online bookstore software project is a web application that serves as a central database containing a wide range of books in stock along with their title, total pages, author name, genre name, and publisher name. This project has been developed using the latest version of Asp.net core MVC 6.0 as the front-end and MSSQL as the back-end.

The SQL database stores various book related details such as the book title, total pages, author name, genre name, and publisher name. In addition, the database contains a repository pattern that helps to improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of database queries and by making use of the database caching mechanism.

The online bookstore web application is designed with a user-friendly interface, and it enables the user to easily browse and search for books in the bookstore. The user can see a wide range of books arranged in respective categories, such as fiction, non-fiction, biography, history, science, and others. The user can also make use of the search functionality to find books by keyword or by filtering on specific criteria such as author, genre, or publisher.

The online bookstore software project also features a DropDownList, which enables the user to select desired books from a list of available books. The user can view the details of the selected book, such as the title, total pages, author name, genre name, and publisher name.

To improve the performance of the application, Linq queries are used to retrieve the required data from the database. Linq provides a simple and efficient way to query data from the database, and it enables developers to write complex queries with ease.

Overall, this online bookstore software project provides a convenient and efficient way for users to browse and search for books, and it provides a central database for managing and maintaining book related information. The use of the repository pattern, DropDownList, Linq query, and SQL database helps to improve the performance and scalability of the application.
